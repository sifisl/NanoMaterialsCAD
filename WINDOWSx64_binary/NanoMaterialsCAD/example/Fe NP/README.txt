This is an example to create a Fe NP with {100} {110} and {111} surfaces.

1. Run NanomaterialsCAD.exe and drag and drop the "POSCAR_Fe_unitcell" file. You sould be able to see the Fe unit cell
2. In the command line (bottom of the program) enter the command supercell(20,20,20) to create a 20x20x20 bulk super cell.
3. From the menu bar (top of the program) go to Edit -> Cubic to create the NP.
4. A NP is now formed and you can change the surfaces using the 'q','w' keys for the {100}, the 'a','s' keys for the {110}, and the 'z','x' keys for the {111} surfaces.
5. ctrl+s to save the system. The file is saved in the same directory as the executable.
