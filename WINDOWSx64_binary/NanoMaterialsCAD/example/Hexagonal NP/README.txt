This is an example to create a hexagonal NP using the perovskite metarial.

1. Run NanomaterialsCAD and drag and drop the POSCAR_perovskite file
2. Enter the command supercell(10,10,15) to create a 10x10x15 super cell. The command line is located at the bottom of the program
3. From the menubar at the top of the program, select Edit -> Hexagonal
4. A hexagonal NP in now created with the {10-10}, {11-20}, and {0001} surfaces. You can change the surfaces with 'q','w' keys for {10-10}, 'a','s' for {11-20}, and 'z','x' for {0001} surfaces.
5. Press ctrl+s to save in the executable's directory.
