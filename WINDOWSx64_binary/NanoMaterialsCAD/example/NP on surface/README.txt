Lets say you have a surface "POSCAR_surf" and a NP "POSCAR_NP" and you want to place the NP on top of the surface. To do so:

1. Run NanoMaterialsCAD and drag and drop the POSCAR_surf to open the surface.
2. Drag and drop the POSCAR_NP to open the NP in the same scene 
3. click on the small + symbol on the top-left corner of the screen and click on the group 2 to select the NP.
4. Right-click anywhere on the screen and select Edit Selected -> Translate or Rotate to move or rotate the NP respectively. Three axis will appear that you can use to drag or rotate the NP.
5. When you plane the NP on the surface, press ctrl+s to save the system. The system is saved in executable's folder.
