This is an example on how to automatically create 10 POSCAR files for a random binary alloy.

1. Run NanoMaterialsCAD and enter the command script("../example/script/script") assuming the files are in their default position. 
2. The script will run and create 10 binary alloys in the folder ../examples/script/Fe-Mo_50-50
